apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

If you have a module defined as an android library project you'll get .aar files for all build flavors (debug and release by default) in the build/outputs/aar/ directory of that project.
your-library-project
    |- build
        |- outputs
            |- aar
                |- appframework-debug.aar
                 - appframework-release.aar
If these files don't exist start a build with
gradlew assemble
